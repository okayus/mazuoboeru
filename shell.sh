#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Open a shell in the running dev sandbox WITH the repo-scoped GitHub token, resolved
# from 1Password and injected into THIS shell only (never into the container config).
#
#   ./shell.sh                      # zsh that can `git push` / `gh pr create`
#   ./shell.sh claude --continue    # or run a command directly
#
# Why not `environment: { GH_TOKEN: ... }` in docker-compose.yml? Then the token is
# part of the container's config, and any `docker compose up -d` that doesn't go
# through `op run` counts as a config change: compose stops and RECREATES the
# container, silently dropping the token and every process inside (including a
# running Claude session). Injecting at exec time keeps `./up.sh` credential-free and
# idempotent. `docker exec -e GH_TOKEN` (name only, no `=value`) forwards the variable
# from this process's environment — the value never appears in argv, so it is not
# visible in `ps` on the host. Fail closed: no op, no token, no push.
