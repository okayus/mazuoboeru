#!/usr/bin/env sh
# Open a shell in the running dev sandbox WITH the repo-scoped GitHub token, resolved
# from 1Password and injected into THIS shell only (never into the container config).
#
#   ./shell.sh                      # zsh that can `git push` / `gh pr create`
#   ./shell.sh claude --continue    # or run a command directly
#
# Two things this script is careful about:
#
# 1. The token is NOT in docker-compose.yml `environment:`. There it would be part of
#    the container's config, so any `docker compose up -d` that doesn't go through
#    1Password counts as a config change: compose stops and RECREATES the container,
#    silently dropping the token and every process inside (including a running agent
#    session). Injecting at exec time keeps `./up.sh` credential-free and idempotent.
#
# 2. The interactive process is NOT wrapped in `op run`. `op run` conceals secrets on
#    the stdout/stderr of its child, i.e. it interposes on those streams — an
#    interactive `docker exec -it` then loses its terminal: the prompt leaks raw
#    escape templates and the pty falls back to 80x24. So resolve the value first with
#    `op read`, then exec docker with the real terminal still attached. The value
#    travels in the environment, never in argv, so it stays out of `ps` on the host.
#
# Fail closed: no 1Password, no token, no push.
# Skill: sandboxed-agent-github-token-via-1password 0.2.1 (exec-time variant).
